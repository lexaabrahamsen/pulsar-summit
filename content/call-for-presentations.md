**Do you have an awesome Pulsar story to share?**

Pulsar Summit is the conference dedicated to Apache Pulsar, and the messaging and event streaming community. The conference gathers an international audience of CTOs/CIOs, developers, data architects, data scientists, Apache Pulsar committers/contributors, and the messaging and streaming community, to share experiences, exchange ideas and knowledge, and receive hands-on training sessions led by Pulsar experts.

Speaking at Pulsar Summit is a great way to connect with hundreds of your peers and become more involved in the community.

We are looking for your inspiring story, real-world application, use case, best practice, or compelling vision of Apache Pulsar and its ecosystem. Winning submissions will make it clear that you understand how to take your knowledge and experience and transfer it to Pulsar Summit attendees. Discuss best practices or lessons learned, present business cases or a success story, and provide details to help attendees get under the hood of your Pulsar deployment.

Thee topics below provide guidelines and suggestions for a compelling proposal.

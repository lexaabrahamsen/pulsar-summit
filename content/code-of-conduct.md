## Overview

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at Pulsar Summit San Francisco are required to agree with the below code of conduct, which will be in effect throughout the entire conference. Cooperation from all participants is expected to ensure a safe and productive environment for everyone.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive across all conference participants and embrace the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As the organizer, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all attendees, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all conference participants, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour. We ask for all attendees to help create a safe and positive experience for everyone.

## Open Source / Culture / Tech Citizenship

We encourage an open source / culture / tech citizenship mentality, whereby all participants recognize and strengthen the relationships between their actions and effects on others. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive actions are essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

## Expected Behavior

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions. Attempt collaboration before conflict. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community engagements online, at our conference and in one-on-one communications. In case the conference venue might be shared with members of the public, please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Anit-Harassment Policy

Pulsar Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled without a refund, at the discretion of the event organizer.

Harassment includes offensive, harmful or prejudicial verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and / or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides);  deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sexual language and imagery will not be tolerated throughout the entire conference, including talks. Exhibitors should also refrain from using sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organizer may take any action deemed appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event without a refund. We expect participants to follow these rules at all sites of the conference venue and related social events.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organizing event team immediately. 

The event team will be happy to help participants contact the location security (as available) or local law enforcement, provide escorts to walk you to/from your room/car/taxi/etc or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We highly value your attendance.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community or event without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid participation).

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the organizer as soon as possible. You can find the contact details of the organizer responsible for the implementation of the code of conduct at the bottom of this page. Additionally, team members are available to help engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe. If required, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the event organizer with a concise description of your grievance, which will be handled in accordance with the existing governing policies.

## Scope

All conference participants (contributors, attendees, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) are asked to abide by this Code of Conduct throughout the entire conference online and in-person, as well as in all one-on-one engagements.
